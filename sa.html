			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>I’ve been asked to introduce The Way Of Kings to you. And I have no idea how to start.</p>
			<p>This is an odd position for me. Before, I’ve found it easy to explain my novels. Each one was built around one or two central premises. The gang of thieves who want to rob an immortal emperor. A man cast down by a terrible, magical disease and forced to rebuild a society among those similarly afflicted. A boy who finds that librarians secretly rule the world.</p>
			<p>Kings has stymied me each time I’ve tried to describe it. I often end up talking about its creation. (How I started work on it over fifteen years ago. How I’ve written hundreds of thousands of words worth of worldbuilding for it. How much the project has come to mean to me over the decades.) But such things describe the book but don’t actually tell you anything. And so this time, I’m going to try to talk about what The Way Of Kings is.</p>
			<p>It’s a book about characters I love. I’ve begun to build a reputation as the “magic system” guy. The author who creates interesting types of magic for every book he writes. On one hand, this delights me, as I do put a lot of effort into the magic in my books. But a great book for me isn’t about a magic, it’s about the people that the magic affects.</p>
			<p>The book started its life many years ago being about a young man who made a good decision. I wrote the entire book that way before realizing I’d done it wrong. So I started over from scratch and had him take the other fork, the more difficult fork. The fork that cast him into some of the worst imaginable circumstances, ground him against the stones of a world where there is no soil or sand on the ground.</p>
			<p>My goal: to prove to myself, and to him, that the “good” decision was not actually the best one. The Way Of Kings is his story, though he shares the space with several others. They’ll get their own books later in the series.</p>
			<p>I want to tell you more, but I don’t have the space here. I want to talk about the art in the book (it’s ambitious, unlike anything I’ve seen tried in an epic fantasy novel before.) I want to talk about the scope of the series, the distinctive world which is so much larger and more real than anything I’ve worked on before. I want to explain the book.</p>
			<p>But, for now, I think it’s best to just show you instead.</p>
			<p>Enjoy.</p>

			<h2>Synopsis</h2>
			<p>Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.</p>
			<p>It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars are fought for them, and won by them.</p>
			<p>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.</p>
			<p>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by overpowering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.</p>
			<p>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under the eminent scholar and notorious heretic Jasnah Kholin, Dalinar’s niece. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan’s motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.</p>
			<p>The result of more than ten years of planning, writing, and worldbuilding, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.</p>
			<p>Speak again the ancient oaths,</p>
			<p>Life before death.<br> Strength before weakness. <br>Journey before destination.</p>
			<p>And return to men the Shard they once bore.</p>
			<p>The Knights Radiant must stand again.</p>

	<div class="stormlight magic stormlight-color">
		<h3>Stormlight</h3>
		<p>Gemstones left outside during a highstorm become infused with Stormlight. The amount of Stormlight collected is not directly proportional to the strength of the highstorm.When Stormlight is not encased within a gemstone, such as when held by a Surgebinder or leaking from damaged Shardplate, it appears as a luminescent white vapor. It also increases the speed at which plants grow. Stormlight can be used to fuel the operation of fabrials or Surgebinding abilities. To use Stormlight, a Surgebinder breathes in the Stormlight and then uses it to power their usage of the various Surges.</p>
		<h3>Soulcasting</h3>
		<p>A Soulcasting fabrial uses Stormlight from a gemstone corresponding to one of the Ten Essences. In order to Soulcast a specific Essence, the Soulcaster needs a piece of the corresponding gemstone attached to it and infused with Stormlight. The Soulcasting then draws Stormlight from the gem. A fabrial is a type of mechanical device, powered by Stormlight that uses spren captured in gemstones to perform a variety of tasks.</p>
		<h3>Surgebinding</h3>
		<p>The Surgebinder can manipulate ten fundamental forces locally known as Surges, with each Surgebinder having access to two of the Surges with overlap between them, by infusing objects or beings with Stormlight.</p>
		<p>The Nahel bond is a symbiotic relationship between humans and spren, through which the human gains Surgebinding powers and the spren gains sapience in the Physical Realm.[8] The spren choose the people they bond with according to the actions and personalities of those people. There are ten types of spren that bond with humans—each granting access to two of the ten Surges, with overlap between them—and each of these types are attracted to different attributes in their bondmates.</p>
		<p>Surgebinding requires constant Stormlight as a fuel source, which the Surgebinder can draw by breathing in. While it is possible to draw the Stormlight from any source infused with it, including directly from the highstorms themselves, the common practice is to use gemstones that have already been infused by the highstorms.</p>

		<h3>The 10 Surges</h3><br>
		<div class="surges">
			<h4>Adhesion</h4>
			<p>The Surge of Adhesion can be manipulated to bind things together. The two orders of Knights Radiant with access to this Surge are the Bondsmiths and the Windrunners</p>
			<div>
				<p><b>Full Lashing:</b> This ability creates an extremely powerful temporary bond between two objects. To use this ability, the Surgebinder infuses a surface with Stormlight, after which any object or person that comes in contact with the surface will be bound to it.</p>
				<p><b>Spiritual Adhesion:</b> Adhesion can be used by a Bondsmith to establish a Connection to someone in order to, at least, speak their language.[26] The full extent of this power is unclear, or whether Windrunners can use Adhesion in this fashion.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Gravitation</h4>
			<p>The Surge of Gravitation can be manipulated to change the direction and strength of an object's gravitational attraction.[23] The two orders of Knights Radiant with access to this Surge are the Windrunners and the Skybreakers</p>
			<div>
				<p><b>Basic Lashing:</b> This ability alters an object's or being's spiritual gravitational bond to the planet below, instead temporarily linking it to a different object or direction. It allows the Surgebinder to run up walls, send objects or people flying off into the air. Lashings only affects gravitational pull and not mass, so different things with different masses will still fall at the same speed.</p>
				<p><b>Reverse Lashing:</b> This ability creates a bubble around a surface that imitates its spiritual link to the ground beneath it. In effect, this makes the infused object pull other objects towards itself. It is much harder for Reverse Lashing to affect objects touching the ground, where their link to the planet is strongest.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Division</h4>
			<p>The Surge of Division can be manipulated to have power over destruction and decay. The two orders of Knights Radiant with access to this Surge are the Dustbringers and the Skybreakers.</p>
			<div>
				<p><b>Decay:</b> Using the Surge of Division, the Surgebinder can touch an object and cause it to burn, turn to dust, or decay in other ways. The Surgebinder can exercise significant control, such as to burn a pattern into a piece of wood. It can also be used on humans.[34] This splits the molecular bonds of the object the Surge is used on, but not the atoms themselves.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Abrasion</h4>
			<p>The Surge of Abrasion can be manipulated to alter the frictional force between two surfaces. The two orders of Knights Radiant with access to this Surge are the Dustbringers and the Edgedancers.</p>
			<div>
				<p><b>Slicking:</b> This ability allows the Surgebinder to make their body frictionless. The Surgebinder can choose which parts of the body are affected and which parts are not. For example, the bottom of the feet can be infused so that the Surgebinder glides over any surface without losing momentum until the ability is suspended.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Progression</h4>
			<p>The Surge of Progression can be manipulated to alter the growth and healing of organisms. The two orders of Knights Radiant with access to this Surge are the Edgedancers and the Truthwatchers.</p>
			<div>
				<p><b>Growth:</b> This ability accelerates organic growth to tremendous speeds. The Surgebinder can infuse the seeds to a plant with Stormlight through skin contact, and in seconds, it will become fully developed. It is unknown if this ability only works on plants.</p>
				<p><b>Regrowth:</b> This ability heals the damage done to the body and the soul of a person instantly and without any scarring. The flesh, muscle, or bones can be completely regrown rapidly. The body can be refreshed and rid of fatigue.[37] The Surgebinder can even reverse death with Regrowth; a body that has bled out or a soul that has been severed with a Shardblade can be healed with Regrowth and continue to function as if it has never been damaged.[36] However, once the soul leaves the body and reaches the afterlife, it is impossible for the Surgebinder to revive the person.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Illumination</h4>
			<p>The Surge of Illumination can be manipulated to create auditory and visual illusions. The two orders of Knights Radiant with access to this Surge are the Lightweavers and the Truthwatchers.</p>
			<div>
				<p><b>Lightweaving:</b> This ability creates visual and auditory illusions. The illusion is based upon not just what the Surgebinder imagines, but also desires to create, requiring both a mental picturing of and a Spiritual connection to the intended creation.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Transformation</h4>
			<p>The Surge of Transformation can be manipulated to change an object into one of the ten essences. The two orders of Knights Radiant with access to this Surge are the Elsecallers and the Lightweavers.</p>
			<div>
				<p><b>Soulcasting:</b> This ability transforms any material into one of the Surgebinder's choice. To Soulcast, the Surgebinder shifts their perception to see into the Cognitive Realm, and communicates with the Cognitive aspect of the object they want to transform. Not every object is inclined to change, depending on how the object is seen by the sentient species and how it sees itself, so the Surgebinder may need to negotiate with it. Once the object is convinced into changing, the Surgebinder infuses it with Stormlight, and the transformation process takes place instantaneously.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Transportation</h4>
			<p>The Surge of Transportation can be manipulated to achieve realmatic transition. The two orders of Knights Radiant with access to this Surge are the Elsecallers and the Willshapers.</p>
			<div>
				<p><b>Elsecalling:</b> This ability allows the Surgebinder to travel in between Realms. A circular wall of Stormlight can be seen briefly at the target location before the Surgebinder arrives. The Surgebinder can also bring other beings and objects with them while Elsecalling. This allows many Surgebinders with Transportation the ability to worldhop. It is much harder to leave the Cognitive Realm than it is to enter it.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Cohesion</h4>
			<p>Also called the Surge of Strong Axial Interconnection, the Surge of Cohesion can be manipulated to alter objects at a molecular level. The two orders of Knights Radiant with access to this surge are the Willshapers and the Stonewards.</p>
			<div></div>
			<h4>Tension</h4>
			<div>
				<p>Also called the Surge of Soft Axial Interconnection, the Surge of Tension can be manipulated to alter the stiffness of an object, such as taking something flexible and making it rigid. The two orders of Knights Radiant with access to this surge are the Stonewards and the Bondsmiths.</p>
				<p>For Bondsmiths, the use of this surge is different from the Stonewards. While Stonewards use this ability to shape stone in battle, Bondsmiths use it to repair inanimate objects as a complement to the surge of Adhesion</p>
			</div>
			<div></div>
		</div><br></br>

		<h3>The Knights Radiant</h3><br>
		<div class="knights stormlight-color">
			<p>The Knights Radiant were an organization of Surgebinders on Roshar. Their Orders were centered at Urithiru, but they lived all across Alethela, the Silver Kingdom who had to maintain the arts of war. They considered it their duty and privilege to stay vigilant for Desolations. It is commonly believed that they betrayed mankind on the Day of Recreance, and were then referred to as the Lost Radiants.</p>
			<p>The Ideals of the Knights Radiant, known as The Immortal Words, serve as a guide to them for how they were to live their lives. Each order of Radiants have five Ideals, with the First Ideal being the same for every order sometimes called the Ideal of Radiance acts as a motto and guide for the entire organization of Knights Radiant, while the four later Ideals are different for every order. The Unique Ideals of Each order are part of a journey to progress them on a path and to keep the Surges from being used without restraint.</p>
