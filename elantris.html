	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p><i>Elantris</i> was Brandon’s first published book. A standalone epic fantasy novel, the book won the Romantic Times award for best epic fantasy of 2005, was chosen by Barnes and Noble.com editors as the best fantasy or sf book of the year, and has been released in twenty languages.</p>

	<h2>Synopsis</h2>

	<p>It’s always interesting to describe your book to people, since a novel like this, at 200,000 words, is going to mean very different things to different people. If you want a more straightforward explanation of what the book’s about, read the Publisher’s Weekly review below. If you want something more casual, read the prologue. If you want something between, read on!</p>
	<p>Tor classifies this book as an epic fantasy. I’m not sure if that’s actually the case. There is no quest in this book, nor is it about the end of the world. It takes place (as many of my books do) in one city, and is a mixture of political intrigue, interesting magic, and character dynamics.</p>
	<p>The setting is the city of Elantris and the surrounding suburbs. There’s a force in Arelon known as the Dor that randomly chooses people and grants them divine powers. Elantris was once the city of the gods, where anyone who was ‘chosen’ went to live. Ten years ago, the Elantrians lost their powers and caught a terrible disease instead. From that point on, Elantris became a prison city/contamination zone for any who caught that disease, for the Dor continues to choose people and curse them.</p>
	<p>The book follows the experiences of three people as they interact with the people of Elantris. Raoden, a prince, catches the disease in chapter one and is thrown into the city by his own father. Sarene, Raoden’s sight-unseen fiancee from a political treaty, arrives in the city and gets involved in schemes, troubles, and politics involving Elantris. Hrathen, a priest and missionary, is sent to convert the people of Arelon, and is told that if he fails, the people of the country will need to be killed instead.</p>
	<p>The three stories intertwine as the truth of what happened to Elantris, and its inhabitants, ten years ago is unearthed.</p>

	<h2>Magic System</h2>
	<h3>AonDor</h3>
	<p>AonDor involves the use of variously shaped Aons, which draw energy from the Dor and must be fine-tuned to the landscape.</p>
	<h4>Aon - First, Language</h4>
	<p>This Aon serves as the starting point for all other Aons.</p>
	<h4>Ashe - Light, Illumination</h4>
	<p>Aon Ashe, when drawn correctly, will emit a bright light, without heat, that is enough to illuminate a large room. Most rooms in Elantris had metal plates inscribed with Aon Ashe that would glow brighter and more steady than  any lantern.</p>
	<h4>Daa - Power, Energy</h4>
	<p>Aon Daa is the preferred offensive weapon by the Elantrians. When drawn successfully a burst of light is emitted that warps and twists the air around it. The light then strikes its target with considerable explosive force.</p>
	<h4>Dii - Wood</h4>
	<p>This Aon includes several circles that represent forests in the south of Arelon.</p>
	<h4>Edo - Protection, Safety</h4>
	<p>In AonDor, Aon Edo creates a thin wall of light. The wall serves as a barrier, drawing more power from the Dor to resist anything pushing against it with equal strength.</p>
	<h4>Ehe</h4>
	<p>Aon Ehe is one of the few Aons that has an origin myth associated with it. When the Aonic peoples first migrated to what would become Arelon, the people were initially afraid of the vacant city of Elantris. King Rhashm (later Raoshem) wanting to overcome this fear chose Elantris as the center of his kingdom. Decades later the Shaod began to take people, including the princess, Elashe. She claimed to have seen Aon Ehe inscribed on a coal in her hearth the day after she was taken. This has led to the belief that a rock or piece of coal inscribed with Aon Ehe is good luck and provides protection against winter spirits.</p>
	<h4>Ene - Wit, Cleverness</h4>
	<p>In modern usage Aon Ene has come to mean intelligence in a general sort of way. Scholars note however that originally it referred to cleverness or the ability to out-wit and out-think an opponent. It was a symbol that was often used to refer to trickster figures, which were called "enefel," literally "Wit Killers" or those who kill with wit. </p>
	<h4>Ien - Wisdom</h4>
	<p>Aon Ien was used in AonDor as the basis for healing. To maximize its potential however required the use of specialized modifiers that could target the part of the body that needed to be healed as well how the healing should take place.</p>
	<h4>Ire - Time, Age</h4>
	<p>The Ire is the name of an organization of Elantrians that appear in Mistborn: Secret History. Not much is known about the group at this stage.</p>
	<h4>Kii - Justice</h4>
	<p>When drawn in AonDor, Kii causes the guilty to feel pain.</p>
	<h4>Nae - Sight, Clarity</h4>
	<p>When drawn in Aon Dor, the circle in the center of the Aon "ripples like water" and then clears, showing a magnified view of what is on the other side. By placing their hand on the center of the circle, an Elantrian is able to move the Aon, thereby changing what is magnified.</p>
	<h4>Rao - Spirit, Essence</h4>
	<p>In AonDor, Aon Rao serves as a power amplifier. The Elantrian Metropolitan District, made up of Elantris and its four Gate Cities, served as a massive Aon Rao that targeted the Elantrians and the Aons they created.</p>
	<h4>Shao - Tranform, Change</h4>
	<p>Aon Shao can be used to create illusions that are tied to pieces of clothing. To do so however requires the extensive use of modifiers.Something changed by Aon Shao would stay permanent if taken to another Shardworld.</p>
	<h4>Tia - Travel, Transportation</h4>
	<p>Aon Tia can be used to transport an Elantrian from one point to another. With the correct modifiers the Elantrian can fix the distance and direction that is to be traveled. When completed the Elantrian grabs the center of the Aon, which becomes solid, and is enveloped by the Aon’s light. They then appear where they directed the Aon to take them. There were a number of metal plates inscribed with this Aon scattered throughout Elantris. An Elantrian would only have to place their hand at the center of the Aon to be transported to another region of the city. However, this Aon can be dangerous. If an Elantrian were to designate their arrival area in the middle of a wall, body of water, etc., without knowing, Aon Tia would transfer them and they could get end up in quite the predicament. Aon Tia can be used to transport off-world.</p>
