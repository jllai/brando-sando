			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>Mistborn is the name of Brandon’s epic fantasy trilogy. The first book is technically Mistborn: The Final Empire, though people just tend to call it Mistborn or Mistborn 1. The entire trilogy consists of The Final Empire (2006), The Well of Ascension (2007), and The Hero of Ages (2008). It’s a hybrid epic fantasy heist story with a focus on political intrigue and powerful action scenes. If you want a more standard review, scroll down to the news media ones. If you want to launch into the chapters, <a href="http://www.brandonsanderson.com/beta/library/10/Mistborn-Prologue">here’s a link</a>. Read directly below for a more casual explanation in Brandon’s own words.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="synopsis">
			<h2>Synopsis</h2>

			<p>I came into this book with two big ideas for the plot. The first was that of a heist story, like Sneakers or Ocean’s Eleven involving a gang of gentlemen thieves who each had a distinctive magic power. I wanted to tell the story of how their different magics and abilities worked together for them to pull an incredible caper.</p>
			<p>The second idea was to write a story about a world where the good guys lost. I wanted to take the standard fantasy story I’d read a dozen times, that of a young peasant hero who went on a quest to defeat a Dark Lord, and turn it on its head. What if the Dark Lord won? What if, in the final climactic moments, he killed the hero and took over the world?</p>
			<p>Hence, Mistborn. A thousand years ago, the prophesied hero from lore rose up to overthrow a great and terrible evil. Only, he lost, and the Dark Lord took over and has been ruling with an iron fist for a thousand years. Ash falls from the sky in this barren land, and mists come every night, deep and mysterious. In this setting, a gang of thieves decides that the prophecies were all lies and that they can’t trust in some fabled hero to save them. They decide to take matters into their own hands, and plan a daring heist of the dark lord himself, planning to use the emperor’s own wealth to bribe his armies away from him and take over the empire.</p>
			<p>Anyway, that’s the ‘back of the book’ movie trailer type explanation. If I talk about it more conversationally, however, the plot takes a back seat to characters. The truth is that while Mistborn grew out of my love for heist movies, it didn’t end up being much of a heist story itself. As early as the planning stages of the series, I felt that I wanted both more scope from the plot and more focus on character.</p>
			<p>During development, the story moved further and further away from the heist. It’s still there, don’t worry, but it’s more of a backdrop now. Instead, the book focuses on Vin, a young girl who gets recruited into the team. Beaten down by a life on the streets, Vin doesn’t realize that she has the power of a Mistborn (the magic in this book, which many say is its prime selling point.) Her dynamic with Kelsier, the charismatic leader of the gang of thieves, is really what drives this novel.</p>
			<p>The book has a little of everything for everyone. Romance, lots of action, a wiz-bang cool magic system, dark lords running amok, great visuals, and character tension. And that’s just book one.</p>

			<h3>Allomancy</h3>
				<div class="mag-desc">
					<p>When a person is born with the hereditary Allomantic ability, they cannot burn metals until the Allomantic ability is awakened in them. The process of Allomancy being activated within a person is called Snapping. Once an Allomancer has Snapped, they will feel a reserve of power in their stomach when they have ingested a metal they can burn. The metals are usually ingested by drinking specifically prepared metal vials, which contain metal flakes suspended in an alcohol solution. <a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Allomancy">Learn more</a></p>

				<p>Lurcher: Burning iron allows the Allomancer to Pull on nearby sources of metal. Pulls must be directly toward the Allomancer's center of gravity. <a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Iron" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
				<p>Coinshot - Burning Steel allows the Allomancer to Push on nearby sources of metal. Pushes must be directly away from the Allomacer's center of gravity. <a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Steel" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>

			<h3>Feruchemy</h3>
			
				<div class="mag-desc">
					<p>Feruchemy is an end-neutral art, meaning thta power is neither gained nor lost. The art also requires metal as a focus, but instead of being consumed, the metal acts as a medium by which ablities within the practitioner are shuttled through time. Invest that metal on one day, withdraw the power on another day.</p>
